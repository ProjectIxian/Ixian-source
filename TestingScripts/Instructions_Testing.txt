Testing procedure overview
==========================

0. Cleanup
.\Start-Testnet -ClearState 
(only neccessary if something crashed badly or if you messed with the wallets/client files)
(Extreme cleanup: Delete folder 'TestClients' and file 'state.xml')

1. Create the folder structure and populate Client data
.\Start-Testnet -NumInstances X
(X has been tested up to ~20 simultaneous nodes - without mining)

2. Once clients are created:
.\Start-Testnet -NumInstances X -StartNetwork
(Everything is automatic. X nodes will be spun up, but only the first 13 are displayed due to length constraings and update speed.)
(After the network is running you can add nodes as specified in the help text: N for normal node, M for miner node.)
(If nodes die/are killed, C will cleanup the display by shifting all nodes to the left - to cover dead ones.)

3. Kill network
Press E to kill all nodes.
Press X to stop display, but leave the nodes running


4. Debugging
When the network is starting up, the full start commands for new nodes are printed. You can copy them almost verbatim into Visual Studio Debug arguments.
Once the network is running, start an additional node from VS via F5 to attach it to the existing network - debugging.


5. Automated test:
.\Perform-Autotest.ps1
(If you have changed the starting API port, specify the argument -APIStartPort, otherwise the default is the same as for .\Start-Testnet.ps1
